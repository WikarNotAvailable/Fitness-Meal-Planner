# Fitness-Meal-Planner
I am going to create a web application that will be used to track eaten food, calories and plan eating routine in general. 
I will implement following features:
- tracking meals and calories
- adding ingredients, meals and recipes to database with their macros 
- planning future meals and automatic creation of shopping list basing on recipes

REST API is going to be created using ASP.NET. Database will be created and managed using Entity Framework Core.
